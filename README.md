# VTLParenCheck
Written by Evan Bruns

Helps debug code in the Velocity Template Language by telling the user where parenthesis do not match.
Will hopefully be expanded to help with more kinds of matching, and to look at the order of matches rather than just the number of opening and closing symbols.
